### Implications of standardized metadata for Ethereum (summary)

Standardized, canonical metadata and naming prevents ecosystem fragmentation and preserves data quality for discovery and analytics. Without discipline, cross‑protocol discovery breaks and the datalake becomes unreliable.

Key points:
- Canonical ID grammar: `org.protocol.domain.role[.variant].v{semver}.{chainId}`
- Required JSON fields: identity, addresses, standards, artifacts, lifecycle, security, tags
- Enforcement: deterministic id, uniqueness, address integrity, backwards compatibility, reserved tokens
- Tooling: JSON Schema in `data/metadata/schema.json`, validator command, CI and pre‑commit checks, legacy aliases
- Governance: lightweight stewardship for new tokens, deprecations instead of deletions

See the full working notes in the exported document used to derive this summary and wire the validator in `bin/contract-naming-cli.js` and `bin/metadata-generator.mjs`.
